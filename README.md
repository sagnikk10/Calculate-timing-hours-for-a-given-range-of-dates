# Calculate-timing-hours-for-a-given-range-of-dates
Create a stored procedure to get the number of hours between two dates having a DateTime format. You should exclude all Sundays and 1st and 2nd Saturdays if it comes within the date range. If either of the input dates are Sunday or the 1st or 2nd Saturday, then include that particular date too.
